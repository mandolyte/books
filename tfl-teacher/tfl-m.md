## Historical Roots of the PCA

The Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) began as a separation from the PCUS (the Southern Presbyterian church) in 1973. Years of struggle preceded that separation. Here are the milestones preceding the birth of the PCA:

-   In the 1950s, the struggle for control of the PCUS by liberals began in earnest. The liberals wanted union with the much larger and more liberal northern church (the PCUSA).
-   By the mid-1960s, several groups had formed to offer alternatives to the PCUS:
    -   The Southern Presbyterian Journal, edited by Dr. Nelson Bell (father in-law to Billy Graham).
    -   Concerned Presbyterians, a lay organization founded to combat the encroaching liberalism. Pastors were not permitted to be members since they faced defrocking by joining.
    -   Presbyterian Evangelistic Fellowship, a group founded for missionary work
    -   Presbyterian Churchman United, a group of more than 500 conservative pastors
-   In 1971, the situation had reached a critical juncture and these four groups met in Atlanta to discuss the situation. They voted to begin planning for a new denomination. They published a statement, which in part read:

> We have reached the point where the situation in our beloved church has become intolerable to thousands of loyal Presbyterians who love the Lord, and want to serve Him in a Presbyterian church which will be true to His Word. We feel that we can no longer be a part of a denomination in which the Board of Christian Education publishes literature which violates our Confession of Faith and encourages our young people to experiment with sex and drugs; in a denomination in which the Board of World Missions no longer places its primary emphasis on carrying out the Great Commission; in a denomination with seminaries which train ministers who substitute social and political action for the preaching of the Word; in a denomination where presbyteries violate our constitution by receiving ministers who refuse to affirm the Virgin Birth. the bodily resurrection and other cardinal doctrines, while denying membership to faithful ministers who stand firmly for these doctrines which they vowed to uphold.

-   In December 4, 1973, delegates from 260 congregations with a combined communicant membership of over 41,000, that had left the PCUS gathered at Briarwood Presbyterian Church in suburban Birmingham, Alabama, and organized the PCA - 122 years to the day after the founding of the Southern Presbyterian Church. In its founding date the PCA consisted of 16 presbyteries.
-   During the 1970s, the denomination added a significant number of congregations outside the South when several UPCUSA churches in Ohio and Pennsylvania joined. Dozens of churches from the Midwest become part of the Presbyterian Church in America leaving the Synod of the West of the PCUSA. Dissenting conservative Southern Presbyterian Churches joined the PCA till the early 1990s.
-   In 1982, the PCA merged with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod, with 25,673 communicant members and 482 ministers in 189 congregations in the United States as well as in a few Canadian provinces. Discussions had begun in 1979 with the RPCES, which had itself been formed in 1965 by a merger of the Reformed Presbyterian Church in North America, General Synod (which maintained a direct historical tie to the Scottish Covenanter tradition) and the Evangelical Presbyterian Church (an offshoot of the Bible Presbyterian Church and not the current denomination by that name). The RPCES brought to the PCA a more broadly national base of membership with a denominational college and seminary (Covenant College and Seminary)
-   In 1983 several PCUS churches that had not joined the PCA in 1973 opted to join the PCA instead of merging with the UPCUSA into the current PC (USA); others joined the recently-formed Evangelical Presbyterian Church, unrelated to the 1950s and 1960s body of that name. A clause in the Plan of Union between the two mainline bodies allowed dissenting PCUS congregations to refrain from joining the merger and to join a denomination of their choosing.

## The PCA Today
Today the PCA has over 1,700 churches with more than 342,000 members in the U.S. and Canada organized into almost 80 Presbyteries.

Some of the committees and agencies of the church are:

-   Christian Education & Publication (CE&P)
-   Mission to the World (MTW)
-   Mission to North America (MNA)
-   Reformed University Ministries (RUM)
-   Covenant Theological Seminary in St. Louis
-   Covenant College in Georgia, near Chattanooga, TN

## PCA Distinctives

*This section is from the PCA overview brochure available from CE&P &copy;*

The PCA was formed to be a denomination that is “Faithful to the Scriptures, True to the Reformed Faith, and Obedient to the Great Commission.” The PCA is an Evangelical and Reformed Presbyterian denomination.

By ***Evangelical***, we mean that we emphasize the gospel (good news of salvation) through faith in Jesus Christ, as well as affirming other orthodox Christian doctrines and holding to the inerrancy of Scripture.

By ***Reformed***, we mean that we connected to the teachings of the historic church and doctrinal beliefs recovered by the Reformation. These doctrinal beliefs are expressed in the *Westminster Confession of Faith* with the *Larger and Shorter Catechisms*. _All officers of the Presbyterian Church in America must personally subscribe to and uphold the teachings of the Westminster Confession of Faith_.

By ***Presbyterian***, we describe our representative form of church government. Local churches are governed by a “Session” of elders, elected by the members of the congregation. Representatives of local churches within a geographical area compose a “presbytery”. Representatives of presbyteries meet annually at “General Assembly”. Thus, through the combined efforts and resources of all tof the churches, we are enabled to advance God’s Kingdom much more effectively. The Committees and Agencies of the PCA help lead this Kingdom work.

## PCA Documents

The Constitution of the Presbyterian Church in America, which is subject to and subordinate to the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, the inerrant Word Of God, consists of its doctrinal standards set forth in the Westminster Confession of Faith, together with the Larger and Shorter Catechisms, and the Book of Church Order, comprising the Form of Government, the Rules of Discipline and the Directory for Worship; all as adopted by the Church.

## What We Believe

-   We believe the Bible is the written word of God, inspired by the Holy Spirit and without error in the original manuscripts. The Bible is the revelation of God’s truth and is infallible and authoritative in all matters of faith and practice.
-   We believe in the Holy Trinity. There is one God, who exists eternally in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
-   We believe that all are sinners and totally unable to save themselves from God’s displeasure, except by His mercy.
-   We believe that salvation is by God alone as He sovereignly chooses those He will save. We believe His choice is based on His grace, not on any human individual merit, or foreseen faith.
-   We believe that Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, who through His perfect life and sacrificial death atoned for the sins of all who will trust in Him, alone, for salvation.
-   We believe that God is gracious and faithful to His people not simply as individuals but as families in successive generations according to His Covenant promises.
-   We believe that the Holy Spirit indwells God’s people and gives them the strength and wisdom to trust Christ and follow Him.
-   We believe that Jesus will return, bodily and visibly, to judge all mankind and to receive His people to Himself.
-   We believe that all aspects of our lives are to be lived to the glory of God under the Lordship of Jesus Christ.
