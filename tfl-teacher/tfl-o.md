# Appendix O – Covenants and Dispensations

## Dispensationalism

**Dispensationalism** is a theological system that teaches biblical history is best understood in light of a number of successive administrations of God's dealings with mankind, which it calls "dispensations." It maintains fundamental distinctions between God's plans for national Israel and for the New Testament Church, and emphasizes prophecy of the end-times and a pre-[tribulation](http://www.theopedia.com/Tribulation) [rapture](http://www.theopedia.com/Rapture) of the church prior to Christ's [Second Coming](http://www.theopedia.com/Second_Coming). Its beginnings are usually associated with the [Plymouth Brethren](http://www.theopedia.com/Plymouth_Brethren) movement in the UK and the teachings of [John Nelson Darby](http://www.theopedia.com/John_Nelson_Darby).

### History

The [Plymouth Brethren](http://www.theopedia.com/Plymouth_Brethren) movement, basically a reaction against the established church in England and its [ecclesiology](http://www.theopedia.com/Ecclesiology), became known for its anti-denominational, anti-clerical, and anti-credal stance. While theologically orthodox, the Plymouth Brethren (Darby in particular) developed unique ideas regarding the interpretation of Scripture while emphasizing prophecy and the [second coming](http://www.theopedia.com/Second_coming) of Christ. The theology of this movement became known as "Dispensationalism."

This new teaching spread in America through prophecy conferences such as the Niagara Bible Conferences (1883-1897). [James H. Brookes](http://www.theopedia.com/James_H._Brookes) (1830-1898), a pastor in St. Louis and prominent figure in the Niagara Conferences, disseminated dispensationalist ideas through his ministry and publications. Most importantly, [Dwight L. Moody](http://www.theopedia.com/Dwight_L._Moody) was sympathetic to the broad outlines of dispensationalism and had as his closest lieutenants dispensationalist leaders such as Reuben A. Torrey (1856-1928), James M. Gray (1851-1925), [Cyrus I. Scofield](http://www.theopedia.com/Cyrus_I._Scofield) (1843-1921), William J. Eerdman (1833-1923), A. C. Dixon (1854-1925), and A. J. Gordon (1836-1895). These men were activist evangelists who promoted a host of Bible conferences and other missionary and evangelistic efforts. They also gave the dispensationalist movement institutional permanence by assuming leadership of the new independent Bible institutes such as the Moody Bible Institute (1886), the Bible Institute of Los Angeles (1907), and the Philadelphia College of the Bible (1914). The network of related institutes that soon sprang up became the nucleus for the spread of American dispensationalism.

### Theology

The dispensations are:

1.  the dispensation of innocence (or freedom), (Gen. 2:8-17,25), prior to Adam's [fall](http://www.theopedia.com/Original_sin),

2.  of conscience, (Gen. 3:10-18; Rom. 2:11-15), Adam to Noah,

3.  of government, (Gen. 9:6; Rom. 13:1), Noah to Abraham,

4.  of patriarchal rule (or promise), (Gen. 12:1-3; 22:17-18; Gal. 3:15-19), Abraham to Moses,

5.  of the Mosaic Law, (Ex. 20:1-26; Gal. 3:19), Moses to Christ,

6.  of [grace](http://www.theopedia.com/Grace), (Rom. 5:20-21; Eph. 3:1-9), the current church age, and,

7.  of a literal earthly 1,000 year [Millennial Kingdom](http://www.theopedia.com/Millennial_Kingdom) that has yet to come but soon will, (Is. 9:6-7; 11:1-9; Rev. 20:1-6).

Each one of these dispensations is said to represent a different way in which God deals with man, specifically a different testing for man. "These periods are marked off in Scripture by some change in God's method of dealing with mankind, in respect to two questions: of sin, and of man's responsibility," explained [C. I. Scofield](http://www.theopedia.com/C._I._Scofield). "Each of the dispensations may be regarded as a new test of the natural man, and each ends in judgment - marking his utter failure in every dispensation."

The idea of different "dispensations" may be found in the writings of some of the [early church fathers](http://www.theopedia.com/Early_church_fathers), and viewing the flow of biblical history as a series of "dispensations" may be seen in some works that pre-date Darby's dispensationalism, such as *L'OEconomie Divine* by Pierre Poiret (1646-1719). But these earlier works did not include the unique testing/failure motif described by Scofield or any hint of the underlying tenets of Darby's dispensationalism.

### Beliefs about the Church and Israel

In addition to these dispensations, the real theological significance can be seen in **four basic tenets** which underlie classic dispensational teaching. Dispensationalism maintains:

1.  a fundamental distinction between Israel and the church, i.e. there are two peoples of God with two different destinies, earthly Israel and the spiritual church,

2.  a fundamental distinction between the Law and Grace, i.e. they are mutually exclusive ideas,

3.  the view that the New Testament church is a parenthesis in God's plan which was not foreseen by the Old Testament, and,

4.  a distinction between the [Rapture](http://www.theopedia.com/Rapture) and the [Second Coming](http://www.theopedia.com/Second_Coming) of Christ, i.e. the rapture of the church at Christ's coming "in the air" (1 Thess. 4:17) precedes the "official" second coming (to the earth) by 7 years of tribulation.

These tenets are supposedly derived from the dispensationalists' insistence on "consistent literalism" in their [hermeneutic](http://www.theopedia.com/Hermeneutics), especially in the literal interpretation of OT prophecies regarding Israel. Crucial to the dispensationalist reading of biblical prophecy, drawn principally from Daniel and Revelation, but also, to some degree, from Ezekiel, is the assertion that the Jewish Temple will be rebuilt on the Temple Mount as a precursor to the Lord returning to restore the earthly Kingdom of Israel centered on Jerusalem. The dispensational movement was therefore fueled by the re-establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. It has grown in popularity particularly since 1967, coinciding with the Arab-Israeli Six Day War, and a few years later in 1970 with the publication of [Hal Lindsey](http://www.theopedia.com/Hal_Lindsey)'s popular book *The Late Great Planet Earth*.

Dispensationalism teaches that the [Second Coming](http://www.theopedia.com/Second_Coming) of Jesus Christ will be a physical event, by which a world-wide kingdom will be established in human history, geographically centered in Jerusalem. Dispensationalists teach that the Second Coming will be a two-step process. In the first step, Christ returns to [resurrect](http://www.theopedia.com/Resurrection) the blessed dead and [rapture](http://www.theopedia.com/Rapture) the living believers from the Earth. After this, a seven year period of [tribulation](http://www.theopedia.com/Tribulation) occurs, climaxing in the Battle of Armageddon. In the second step, Christ intervenes at the Battle of Armageddon and establishes a literal 1000-year millennial kingdom on earth. As such, some Dispensationalists are often associated with the circulation of end times [prophecy](http://www.theopedia.com/Prophecy), which professes to read omens of the Second Coming in current events; however, other Dispensationalists have criticized this apocalypticism popularized by authors such as Hal Lindsey.

### Premillennialism and dispensationalism

By way of clarification, it should be noted that while all
dispensationalists are by definition [premillennial](http://www.theopedia.com/Premillennialism) in their eschatology, not all premillennialists are dispensational in their theology. Historic Premillennialism (e.g. in [George Eldon Ladd](http://www.theopedia.com/George_Eldon_Ladd)) rejects pre-tribulationalism, dispensationalism's radical tenets, and its uniquely Jewish view of the 1000 year millennium. Historic premillennialism may be traced back to some of the early church fathers where it was sometimes termed "chiliasm."

### Dispensational theology in Christianity at large

Prior to dispensationalism, [Covenant Theology](http://www.theopedia.com/Covenant_theology) was the prominent [Protestant](http://www.theopedia.com/Protestantism) view regarding redemptive history and is still the view of the Reformed churches. Outside of Protestantism, however, other Christian branches (e.g., Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, or Roman Catholicism) have not embraced any form of dispensationalism.

## Covenant Theology

**Covenant Theology** is a framework for understanding the overarching storyline of the bible, which emphasizes that God's redemptive plan and his dealings with mankind are, without exception, worked out in accordance with the covenants that he has sovereignly established.

### History

Although the importance of the divine covenants has been realized since the time of the earliest church fathers, Covenant Theology was not articulated as a thoroughly developed system, taking into account the entire extent of biblical revelation, until the days of the sixteenth and seventeenth century reformers, such as the influential Johannes Cocceius and Herman Witsius. The Westminster Confession of Faith is a landmark seventeenth century document that displays a robust, fully-developed Covenant Theology throughout.

### Theology

Basically, Covenant Theology organizes biblical revelation around three unified but distinct covenants:

1.  The Covenant of Redemption, between the persons of the Trinity in eternity past, in which the Father promises to give a people to the Son as his inheritance, and the Son undertakes to redeem them. See *Summary of Christian Doctrine by Berkhof, Chapter XIII* for details.

2.  The Covenant of Works, which God enjoined upon Adam in the Garden, solemnly promising him eternal life if he passed the probationary test in the Garden of Eden (also, many covenant theologians see the covenant given on Mount Sinai as being in some sense a republication of the Covenant of Works). See SCD, chapter XI.

3.  And, finally, the Covenant of Grace, which God first entered into with Adam immediately after the Fall, when he promised to send a Seed of the woman, who would defeat the tempting serpent (Gen. 3:15). In the Covenant of Grace, God promises a champion to fulfill the broken Covenant of Works as a representative of his people, and so to earn its blessings in their behalf. All the later covenants of the bible, such as those which God confirmed to Noah, Abraham, David, and the New Covenant which promises to fulfill these prior covenants in the prophecies of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, are all organically connected, essentially being different administrations of the one eternal Covenant of Grace, which build upon each other   and are all brought to completion in the New Covenant which Christ inaugurated with his shed blood. See SCD, chapter XIII.

Different theologians, have proposed several different definitions of a biblical covenant; but perhaps the best is O. Palmer Robertson's phrase, “A bond-in-blood sovereignly administered” (*The Christ of the Covenants*, P&R Publishing, p. 15). Covenants are typically characterized by a visible sign and seal, which serves to “remind” God of his promises to those whom he has entered into covenant with. Some examples of these covenant signs are the rainbow, given to Noah; circumcision, given to Abraham; and baptism and the Lord's Supper, given to believers after the coming of Christ. See SCD XI.4.b for a description of the elements of a covenant.

### Israel and the Church

The clear teaching of the New Testament is that the modern day Church is really just the expansion of God's people Israel. According to Paul, being an Israelite has never been based merely on outward ethnicity (Rom. 2:28-29; 9:6-8); but those who have been called according to God's promise are Abraham's true seed (Rom. 9:8). Hence, all who have faith are Abraham's children, and the true Israel of God (Rom. 4:11-17; Galatians 3:6-9, 26-29; 4:21-31; 6:16; Phil. 3:3; 1 Pet. 2:9-10; Rev. 2:9). When Paul deals extensively with the whole question of the place of Jews and Gentiles in the people of God, in Romans 11, he shows that there is just one people, symbolized by one good olive tree; unbelieving ethnic Jews may be broken off of that tree of true Israel and believing Gentiles may be grafted in; but there is still one tree, one body, one people of God. Thus, Paul teaches elsewhere that there is no difference between Jew and Gentile in Christ (Gal. 3:26-29; Col. 3:11), but that all believers are members of the same body, citizens of the one commonwealth of Israel, inheritors of all the promises made to Abraham (Eph. 2:11-22; 3:6; Gal. 4:26-31; Phil. 3:20; Heb. 12:22-23). In short, there is and always has been one people of God, and that people includes all those who are grafted in to God's “good olive tree” to become Abraham's children by faith, whether ethnic Jews or Gentiles.

### Eschatology

Covenant theology rejects the Dispensational variety of premillennialism, but accepts any of the historic views of premillennialism, postmillennialism, and amillennialism. Both premillennialists and postmillennialists will look to Old Testament prophecies of a golden age of gospel success on the earth (e.g. Psalm 22:25-31; Psalm 72; Isaiah 2:1-5), and say these prophecies require a time in which the earth will not be in its eternal state, where no one marries or dies any more, and is vastly more prosperous than it is now. Amillennialists, on the other hand, look to the many New Testament passages that suggest that, when Christ returns, he will at once raise the wicked and righteous dead, enact his final judgment, dissolve the old heavens and earth, and bring in the new, eternal state. When he comes, the Church will still have her enemies and persecutors, and evil men and imposters will be waxing worse and worse (see Dan. 12:1-2; Mat. 24:29-31; 25:31-46; John 5:28-29; 2 Thess. 1:6-10; 1 Cor. 15:51-57; 2 Pet. 3:3-14). Amillennialists view Old Testament prophecies as having either a spiritual fulfillment or an eternal fulfillment. So the prophecy of a lion lying down with a lamb may be fulfilled by the gospel bringing together in peace and those that had historically hated and killed each other. Finally, amillennialists view some prophecies employed by post- and premillennialists as having a final fulfillment in the eternal state. Thus, today in the Church, we receive a foretaste of those prophecies; but we will not see them perfectly fulfilled until God creates the new heavens and the new earth, where righteousness dwell. See Appendix I for a comparison of the millennial views.
