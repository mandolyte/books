## BCO Preface:

1.  **Who is the head of the church? (Isaiah 9:6-7)**

	Jesus Christ is the head of the church. No provision is given in Scripture for the supremacy or imminence of any Christian or heathen. It belongs to His majesty to teach the church through His word and Spirit by the ministry of men. What the head is to the body Christ is to the church.

1.  **Where did the church receive her system of government?**

	Christ has ordained all offices, ordinances, system of government, discipline and worship through the scripture or what may be deduced from it.

1.  **What three documents make up the constitution (doctrinal standards) of the Presbyterian Church in America? Of what are  these documents subject and subordinate to?**

	The constitution of the PCA consists of the writings of the Westminster Confession of Faith, the Larger and Shorter Catechisms, and the Book of Church Order. All three are subordinate to the Old and New Testament scripture.

## BCO Chapter 2 and 3

1.  **What is the purpose of the church?**

	The purpose of the church is to:

	- Proclaim, administer and enforce the law of Christ revealed in scripture.
	- Edify and govern God’s people.
	- Propagate the faith and evangelize the world.

1.  **Whose law is the church to enforce? How does the church rightly influence political affairs?**

	The power of the church is exclusively spiritual. It is to enforce the law of Christ revealed in scripture. Scripture is not man’s or the state’s law. The church has no right to construct or modify a government for the state. Matthew 22:21

## BCO Chapter 8 and 9

1.  **Who are the members of the church?**

	All those who have made a profession of faith in Christ, have been baptized, and admitted by the Session to the Lord’s Table along with their children. Children of believers are, through the covenant and right of birth considered non-communing members of the church.

1.  **Describe the office of deacon as indicated in the Book of Church Order and support from scripture. (Acts 6)**

	The office of deacon is one of sympathy and service. Deacons must minister to those who are in need, to the sick, friendless, and distressed. They must help train church members in generosity and devise effective methods of collecting and distributing the gifts of the people. They also have the care of the church buildings and properties entrusted to them. Deacons are under the authority of the Session.

1.  **What is the difference between the work of the elders and of the deacons?**

	Elders are entrusted with the spiritual oversight and government of the church, and deacons are entrusted with the physical oversight and care for the church.

1.  **If there is a disagreement between the Diaconate and the Session, which body has the final word?**

	The Session

1.  **List some of the duties of the elder.**

	Oversight over the body of Christ; Godly example to the church; Govern the church; Exercise discipline over the church; Instruct the ignorant, nourish and guard the church

	- To instruct and guide members

1.  **What constitutes an offense?**

	An offense is anything in the doctrine or actions of a church member professing faith in Christ which is contrary to scripture. Offenses can be personal or general, private or public, but all are sins against God.

## BCO Chapter 30

1.  **What are the types of censure?**

	- Admonition – formal reproof of an offender by the church court
	- Suspension from the Sacraments – temporary exclusion from the Sacraments
	- Suspension from office – exclusion of a church officer from his office. Suspension from the sacraments is always accompanied with suspension from office.
	- Excommunication – removal of the offender from communion of the church
	- Deposition from office – degradation of an officer from his office

## BCO Chapter 35-36 with 27-5

1.  **What should you do if you know a church member or a church officer to be a guilty of an offense (see Matthew 18:15-17; Galatians 6:1-5)?**

	- First go to the offender individually, if he or she does not repent
	- Take 1 or 2 witnesses, if he or she still does not repent
	- Take the matter to the Session

## BCO Chapter 47-49

1.  **What is the goal or goals of pure, public worship?**

	It is a meeting of the triune God with His people, and a time for those people to give Him glory. It is also to build up and encourage the people of God.

1.  **What is the duty of all members on the Lord’s Day?**

	Members must keep the Lord’s Day holy (the whole day). They must remember and prepare before its approach and participate in public and private worship. Provision is made in scripture for works of piety, mercy, and necessity.
