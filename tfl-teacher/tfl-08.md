## Of Good Works
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 16; SCD Chapter 22
- Shorter Catechism 39


1.  **What are good works?**

	Good works of faith come only from what God commands in his Holy Word [WCF 16.1]. See also SCD 22.3

1.  **What are good works evidence of?**

	Good works are evidence of faith, that sanctification is working in us. [WCF 16.2]

1.  **What is God’s role in our good works? Our role?**

	The ability to do good works of faith does not come from within ourselves, but comes entirely from the Spirit of Christ. He chooses us "to do his good pleasure". [WCF 16.3] We must seek to stimulate the effect of God's grace already in us.

1.  **In what sense are some “works” called “good”?**

	By virtue of common grace, unbelievers can perform works that are in external conformity to the law and serve laudable purposes. [SCD 22.3]

1.  **In what sense may our works never be “good”?**

	When we do the very best possible, we only do our duty, having produced nothing more than the minimum. The good works of faith, while aroused by the Holy Spirit, are marred and mixed with much weakness and imperfection [WCF16.5]

1.  **How should good works done by unbelievers be viewed?**

	The unbeliever can do *relative* good works, however, he does not intend to glorify God in them. The unbeliever is an enemy of God, is contrary to God and cannot please Him. They may pay their bills, mow their lawn, love their children and be kind to their neighbors but they are divorced from any thoughts toward God and their good works being on His behalf for His glory. Their good works is to their own benefit. Also their good works are not covered in the righteousness of Christ, which is the only way any works can be made acceptable to God. [WCF 16.7]

## Of the Perseverance of the Saints
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 17
- SCD Chapter 22
- Shorter Catechism 36


1.  **What are the main points of this teaching?**

	- The Christian perseveres in faith, endurance, hope, love, obedience, enjoying and glorifying God
	- It wholly depends on God, not our works or obedience in any way

	*from WCF 17.2*

1.  **What are some “means of preservation”?**

	- The work and intercession of Christ, see Hebrews 10:10
	- The indwelling of the Holy Spirit, see 1 John 2:27
	- The promises and nature of the covenant of grace, see Jeremiah 32:40

1.  **Explain the harmony of apostasy and perseverance.**

	Apostasy is evidence that regeneration was never present. See parable of the sower for the different ways in which the word may be received. However, even the believer may experience times of sin and may be far from a healthy relationship with God - see WCF 17.3.

## Of the Assurance of Grace and Salvation
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 18
- SCD Chapter 22
- Shorter Catechism 36


1.  **On what is our assurance founded?**

	- It is an infallible assurance of faith founded upon the divine truth of the promises of salvation
	- the inward evidences of the those graces unto which these promises are made
	- the testimony of the Spirit of adoption witnessing with our spirits that we are children of God

	*from WCF 18.2*

1.  **Can our assurance be shaken?**

	Yes, assurance is not so much a part of the essence of faith, but that a true believer may wait long and face many difficulties before partaking of it. [WCF 18.3] True believers may have the assurance of their salvation shaken diminished, etc. by sin, temptation, or even by God's withdrawal for a season.

1.  **How can the believer deal with doubts?**

	Continue to seek the love of Christ and fellowship of other believers, being sincere and honest with God; continue the works of faith and one's assurance and feelings of trust will follow.
