# Class 4: Creation and Fall

## Of Creation
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 4; SCD Chapters 9, 11
- Appendix K - Christianity and Modern Science
- Shorter Catechism 9,10


1.  **What important points do you find in this chapter?**
	- That creation was out of nothing (and into nothing) [WCF 4.1]
	- Creation was at the beginning, thus time itself is part of creation [SCD 9.1.a]
	- Humans were created good, but with liberty to change [WCF 4.2]

1.  **Why did God create the universe?**

	It pleased God to do so. It shows the glory of his eternal power, wisdom, and goodness. [WCF 4.1] It was not created because God was lonely and wanted companionship. It was not created to make us happy. [SCD 9.1.b]
1.  **Describe the original state of mankind?**

	We were created with immortal souls, with knowledge, righteousness, and holiness - in other words, in the image of God himself. We had the law of God written on our hearts and the power to fulfill it. Yet we had the liberty to disobey. While we obeyed God, we had true happiness, communion with God, and had dominion over other creatures. [WCF 4.2]
1.  **To what important principles should a Christian scientist hold?**

	a)  Quoted from Van Til: “… revelation in nature and revelation in Scripture are mutually meaningless without one another, and mutually fruitful when taken together.

	b)  Always try to pinpoint where the church can may have no objection to a scientific theory and when a theory is hostile to the church.

	c)  All scientific theories must be held loosely. The history of science shows clearly that new theories overthrow old theories.

## Of Providence
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 5; SCD Chapter 10
- Shorter Catechism 11,12


1.  **What comfort should you find in the doctrine of providence? *[Discussion, see WCF 5.5, 5.7]***

	We let God be God and we are freed from trying to control and run the world. We are enabled to trust God and His good intentions and this not only brings security but courage and perseverance. We begin to understand more of his character and will. We pray more (secondary cause), read His word more, love Him more. We should be humble and grateful before God having our hearts drawn toward Him in worship. It convinces us that we are not the critical point in evangelism and at the same time compels us to pray. See also Genesis 50:30.

	Other discussion questions:
	- What is the difference between providence and fate? Providence is the working out of God's loving plan in the lives of his people. Fate is the cold, mechanical, random events of history without a plan or purpose.
	- If providence is true, why should we pray?

1.  **What alternatives does the world offer to this teaching? How well do they respond to the inner needs for meaning, significance, and transcendence? *[Discussion]***

	Consider alternatives such as Deism, Pantheism, Atheism. How do they respond to the deep inner need for meaning, significance, and transcendence. See SCD 10.2.a & b; also Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 1.
1.  **Define the meaning of providence. What is a “secondary cause”?**
	- *Providence* is that work of God in which He preserves all His creatures, is active in all that happens in the world, and directs all things to the appointed end. [SCD 10, first paragraph] and "God … doth uphold, direct, dispose, and govern all creatures, actions, and things, from the greatest to the least, by his most wise and holy providence."" [WCF 5.1]
	- *Secondary causes* are the ordinary cause and effect observed in the world. Prayer may be viewed as a secondary cause - a "means" by which God accomplishes his "ends".

## Of the Fall
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 6; SCD Chapter 12
- Shorter Catechism 13-20


1.  **Define the two kinds of sin.**
	- *Original sin:* the sin of our first parents, by which they fell from original righteousness, became dead in sin. This same sin corrupted our nature and this corruption passes to all, leaving us utterly indisposed, disabled, and wholly inclined to do all evil.
	- *Actual sin:* the sin and transgressions committed by ourselves.

1.  **Does sin consist only in outward behavior? Give scriptural support.**

	No, sin includes transgressions in one's inner life, such as envy, pride, lusts, etc. Matthew 15: 10ff
1.  **Why does Adam’s sin affect us?**

	We are now fallen creatures and share a corrupt nature that is hostile to God.
1.  **How does it affect us?**

	The results of the first sin are:
	-   Man lost the image of God in a restricted sense, original righteousness, holiness, and power (ability)
	-   Man became guilty and utterly corrupt (totally depraved)
	-   Man fell under the condemnation of death and the wrath of God
	-   All men are guilty "in Adam" and born with a corrupt nature and into a state of sin, which is enmity and rebellion toward God.

1.  **How can we escape the effects of sin?**

	We can never escape the effects of sin in this life, even when forgiven through the redemptive work of Christ. [WCF 6.5]
