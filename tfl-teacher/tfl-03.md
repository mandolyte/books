# Class 3: God and Scripture

## Of Holy Scripture
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 1
- SCD Chapters 2,3
- Appendix A - Inerrancy
- Shorter Catechism 1-3


1. **What important points are made in the first chapter of the WCF?**
    - the necessity of scripture (1.1)
    - complete assurance of the authority of scripture is by the “inward working of the Holy Spirit” (1.5)
    - the accessibility of scripture (“perspicuity”) (1.7)
    - the need for translations (1.8)
    - the principle of scripture interprets scripture (1.9)

1.  **Describe the two types of revelation? How do they differ? What does each reveal?**
    - General Revelation takes the form of facts, forces, and laws of nature; the constitution and operation of the human mind; the facts of experience and history (SCD 2.2)
    - Special Revelation is scripture, a revelation in which facts and words go hand in hand, the words interpreting the facts and the facts giving substance to the words (SCD 2.3)
    - General Revelation alone cannot provide “that knowledge of God and of His will which is necessary for salvation” (WCF 1.1). It nonetheless has value, since it accounts for the true elements of other religions and it is common ground between believers and unbelievers (SCD 1.2.b)
    - General Revelation reveals some aspects of God's character, whereas Special Revelation reveals not only a fuller account of God's character but also his plan to save his people.

1.  **How has revelation ceased? Why?**
    -   In former times, God spoke through prophets and other ways. The message was limited in audience. See Hebrews 1:1 and 2:4
    - While former means may not have entirely ceased, those means, as before are generally limited in audience, often to individuals. In scripture we have a more certain communication from God, being the inspired words of the prophets and apostles and which is unlimited in its audience.

1.  **What does I.2 mean when it says that all scripture is “given by inspiration”? What evidence of inspiration is there?**

    It means that God spoke through the writers, in concert with their own abilities and style, so that the words were as if spoken by God directly. Proofs include:
    - Many texts begin with “thus saith the Lord”
    - New Testament writers quote from the Old Testament attributing the words to God or the Holy Spirit
    - 2 Timothy 3:16 “All scripture is breathed out [inspired] by God ...”

    *Other terms:*
    - Plenary Inspiration: every part of scripture is inspired
    - Verbal Inspiration: inspiration extends to the very words used

1.  **What is the only certain method of interpreting scripture?**

    Scripture is the only infallible interpreter of scripture. From 1.9: “... any question about the true and complete sense of a passage in the Bible (which is a unified whole) can be answered by referring to other passages which speak more clearly.”

1.  **What is the role of scripture in the life of the believer and the church?**
    - From 1.10: “the Holy Spirit speaking in the Bible is the supreme judge of all religious controversies, … , all human teachings, and every private opinion.” Scripture is the final court of appeal and we must submit to its judgment.
    - *Note that since scripture does not speak on every conceivable topic, it is the “Holy Spirit speaking in the Bible” that is claimed to be authoritative. We believe and rely on the Holy Spirit to guide the church in how to apply scripture to our lives.*

1. **Explain the concept of “autographa” and how it supports inerrancy.**

    The “autographia” refer to the original texts as written. We don’t claim inerrancy for the copies of these, only for these originals. Analysis shows such large agreement between the copies, that we are assured that our copies are accurate and reflect God’s providence.

1. **[Optional] Why is scripture covered before God himself?**

    While creation, providence, and inward illumination clearly show God's goodness, wisdom, and power, only scripture contains what is needed for salvation. Scripture is God's self-revelation to his people and, as such, provides an authoritative disclosure of God and his qualities, attributes.

## Of God, and of the Holy Trinity
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 2
- SCD Chapters 4,6,7
- Shorter Catechism 4-6


1.  **Give examples of both communicable and incommunicable attributes of God.**
    - *Communicable*: Knowledge, wisdom, goodness, love, mercy, grace, holiness, righteousness, etc.
    - *Incommunicable*: Independence, immutability, infinity, simplicity

1.  **Describe the Trinity? What are the roles of each person?**
    - The Bible teaches that, while God is one, he exists in three Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (SCD 7.1)
    - The Father has planned the work of redemption, creation, and providence
    - The Son is our mediator, savior, redeemer
    - The Holy Spirit brings to completion both creation and redemption

1.  **What errors have crept into the church about the Trinity, both past and present?**

    Nearly all cults or divergences from orthodoxy fall into one of these errors:
    - Modalism: the different persons are different modes of the same being, expressed one at a time, not co-eternal or actually existing
    - Unitarianism: Jesus is a man, the Spirit a divine influence (Jehovah's Witnesses)
    - Polytheism: All three are Gods, different; God isn't a unique being (Mormons)

1.  **How does God differ from the god(s) of other religions?**

    Polytheism (many gods), Pantheism (creation and god are the same or god infuses all things), Humanism (we are gods; “man is the measure of all things”)

## Of God’s Eternal Decree
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 3
- SCD Chapter 8
- Shorter Catechism 7-8, 88-90


1.  **What are the main points of this chapter?**
    - God has ordained all that comes to pass
    - God is not the author of sin
    - His decree is *not* based on his foreknowledge
    - His decree extends to salvation
    - His decree includes the means and the ends, which establishes the meaning and purpose of prayer, good works, evangelism, etc.

1.  **How do we defend against the charge that “God is the author of sin”?**
    - By ordaining both the ends and the means, our freedom, will, and experiences are established (3.1)
    - To be otherwise, means our lives are driven by chance and devoid of meaning and purpose
    - With respect to sin, the decree is permissive (SCD 8.1.a)

1.  **How do we defend the freedom of the will? What does “free will” mean? Not mean?**
    - God's plan includes the free choices of His creatures
    - We are responsible for our choices, our free acts
    - Harmonizing God's plan with our freedom may not ever be completely satisfactory.
    - Our freedom, our choices are always limited by our natures; we may want to fly like a bird, but we are not birds and it isn't possible. We have sinful natures and our will is bound to follow our nature.

1.  **Describe the logical order of our salvation.**
    - Chosen, predestined
    - Called, regenerated, converted
    - Justified
    - Adopted
    - Sanctified
    - Glorified

    Scriptures include: Romans 8:28-30, John 3:5, Ephesians 2:5-10, John 10:25-29
