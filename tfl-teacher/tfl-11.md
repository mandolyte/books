1.  **What are sacraments? Of what benefit are they to believers?**

	We observe two sacraments: Baptism and the Lord's Supper.

	*Definition*: a sacrament is a holy ordinance instituted by Christ, in which by sensible signs the grace of God in Christ is represented, sealed, and applied to believers, and they, in turn express their faith and obedience to God. We benefit because they are a means of grace. [SCD 25.2.a]

	*Means of Grace*: There two means of grace: the Word of God and the sacraments. They strengthen faith and are a means of growth.

1.  **What makes the sacraments effective?**

	The efficacy is in the work of the Holy Spirit and God's Word which institutes the service. God's Word authorizes the services and promises spiritual benefits to worthy recipients. [WCF 27.3]

	Where the sacrament is received in faith, the grace of God accompanies it. [SCD 25.2.a]

1.  **Who may administer them?**

	They may be dispensed only by a minister of the Word constitutionally ordained [WCF 27.4]

1.  **What is the relationship between the Word of God and the sacraments?**

	The word of God is complete as a means of grace, but the sacraments are not complete without the word of God:

	- the Word is absolutely necessary, while the sacraments are not
	- the Word serves to beget and to strengthen faith while the sacraments can only strengthen it
	- the Word is for all the world, but the sacraments are only for believers and their children [SCD 25.2]

1.  **What are the three parts of the sacraments?**

	- The outward and visible sign
	- The inward spiritual grace signified
	- The union between the sign and the thing signified [SCD 25.2.a]

1.  **Describe our state after death. What happens to our bodies? to our souls?**

	Our bodies decay and return to dust. Our souls return to God. The souls of the righteous are received into God's presence; the souls of the wicked are consigned to hell.

1.  **What happens to our bodies and souls at the resurrection?**

	The dead receive new bodies and those alive at his coming are changed. The new body and soul will be united forever.

1.  **What are other views of death and resurrection? Especially views on the “intermediate state”. *[Discussion]***

	Consider the following:

	- Purgatory, soul sleep, annihilation, second probation
	- Connect each of these with the final state of heaven or hell

## Of the Last Judgment
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 33
- SCD Chapters 29,30
- Appendix H - Areas of Agreement in Last Things
- Appendix I - The Millennium


1.  **Describe the Last Judgment (commonly the “Second Coming of Christ”)?**

	On the last day, Christ as Judge will judge everyone according to their deeds done in the body, whether good or bad. All men will give an account of thoughts, words, and behavior. His assistants will be angels (Mt 13:4, 42) and saints (1 Cor 6:2-3; Rev 20:4). For the believer this will be a clear demonstration of God's grace and mercy for the elect. The unbeliever will be consigned to eternal torment and banished from the grace of God, but will know the presence of His wrath eternally. This will take place at the end of the world immediately after the resurrection of the dead.

1.  **What events precede the Second Coming? [SCD 29.1]**

	- The calling of the gentiles
	- The conversion of the full number of Israel
	- The great apostasy and tribulation
	- The coming of the Antichrist
	- Signs and wonders

1.  **What is the “millennium” and what are the main views concerning it?**

	It is a reign of Christ, sometimes taken as a literal 1000 years. The main views are (see Appendix for summaries of each):
	- Premillennialism
	- Amillennialism
	- Postmillennialism
