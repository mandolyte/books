# Appendix H - Areas of Agreement in Last Things

by Alan Foster

*“To die will be an awfully big adventure.”* Peter Pan

**Death:**

Death is certain (Heb. 9:27.) It is due to sin, disobedience, and rebellion. Death is deeply wrong. It is an aberration. It is not natural and is not part of the original design.

**The Return of Christ:**

-   It will be a literal, physical event. 1 Thess. 4:13-18
-   Christ will return in the same way He left. Acts 1:9-11
-   It ought to be a comforting, encouraging event that we anticipate. Titus 2:13
-   No one knows when it will be. 1 Thess. 5:1-2
-   We are to be prepared for it. Matt. 24:36
-   We should be faithful stewards until He comes. Matt. 24:45-51

**Judgment:**

-   God’s judgment is based on truth. Rom. 2:2
-   God’s judgment is unbiased. Rom. 2:11
-   God’s judgment is certain. Heb. 9:27
-   God’s judgment is righteous. Rom. 2:5
-   God’s judgment is individual. Rom. 2:15
-   God’s judgment is scrutinizing. Rom. 2:16, 1 Cor. 4:5
-   There are two types of judgments:
    -   of unbelievers. Rev. 20:11-15
    -   of believers. 1 Cor. 3:12-15

**Heaven:**

-   The experience of being with God unhindered by sin.
-   The presence of God implies the blessing of God.
-   A home that we have never seen
-   The end of desire, need, lack and want.
-   The fulfillment of hope, expectation and yearning.

*“Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father’s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.”* John 14:1-3

**Hell:**

-   It is eternal death, eternal separation from God.
-   It is eternal fire and burning, prepared for Satan and his angels. The New Testament sometimes refers to it as Gehenna. This was a place outside the city walls of Jerusalem where refuse and dead bodies were burned.
-   It is utter, absolute darkness, because the light of God is not there.

**The Intermediate State:**

What happens to people, both believers and unbelievers, between the time of death and the resurrection? Hades or Heaven.

The Eternal State:

-   Body and soul will be reunited.
-   Believers and unbelievers will spend eternity in separate places.
-   Unbelievers will spend eternity in torment. It is alternately known as Hell or the Lake of Fire. It is characterized by “weeping and gnashing of teeth,” which symbolize pain, suffering and despair.
-   Believers will spend eternity in the joy of everlasting fellowship with the Father and the Son. It is known as the ‘New Jerusalem’ or the ‘New Heaven and the New Earth.’ Its inhabitants are listed in Hebrew 12:22-24.
-   The New Heaven and the New Earth will be a perfect place, not subject to decay (see Rom. 8:18-23.) God is about the business of restoring and fulfilling, not destroying. A picture of this place is given in Revelation 21 and 22:1-5.

**The Resurrection Body:**

-   Imperishable
-   Glorious
-   Powerful
-   Spiritual --- 1 Cor. 15:42-44

It is likely that we will be able to recognize one another, just as the resurrected Christ was recognizable.
