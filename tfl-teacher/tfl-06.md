# Class 6: The Plan of Salvation
## Of Effectual Calling
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 10
- SCD Chapters 18, 19
- Shorter Catechism 29-32


1.  **What is the “effectual call”?**

	Definition: The effectual call is when the Holy Spirit enlightens our mind and heart spiritually and regeneratively so that we understand Christ. He makes our dead stone heart alive toward Him. He renews and makes free our ability to choose His purposes. He draws us to Himself and we freely choose to come. [WCF 10.1]

	Important Points:
	- Only the elect are effectually called
	- It is not based on any merit of our own
	- It is through the work of the Holy Spirit that the call becomes "effective"

1.  **What is “common grace” and who does it benefit? Distinguish from “special grace”.**

	Common grace is both: [SCD 18.1]
	- those general operations of the Holy Spirit whereby sin is restrained, order is maintained in social life, and civil righteousness is promoted
	- those general blessings which God imparts to all men without distinction as He sees fit

	Common grace benefits all.

	Special grace is that operation of the Holy Spirit whereby the elect are regenerated, reborn, made new and then are converted.
1.  **What is the differences between an “external” and an “internal” call?**
	- The *external* call consists in the presentation and offering of salvation in Christ to sinners, together with an earnest exhortation to accept Christ by faith in order to obtain the forgiveness of sins and eternal life.
	- The *internal* call is the external call made effective by the operation of the Holy Spirit. It always comes to the sinner through the Word of God, savingly applied by the operations of the Holy Spirit.

1.  **Is everyone “called” who hears the gospel? Explain.**
	- Yes - they hear a presentation of the gospel
	- No - not all who hear are quickened and respond in true faith

1.  **Can someone be saved apart from the ministry of the Word? How? Give examples.**

	While hearing the gospel and having the Holy Spirit work in our hearts to respond is the normal method, salvation does not absolutely depend on the sharing of the gospel. This would make salvation a hybrid of man's and God's work - which would be no sure salvation at all. The ministry of the Word is a means to an end. The only necessary work is that of the Holy Spirit. Thus children dying in infancy may be elect. Similarly, others who are unable to understand or respond may be elect. There may be cases, where God may choose to reveal Himself directly when no normal presentation of the gospel is possible.

## Of Justification
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 11
- SCD Chapters 20, 21
- Shorter Catechism 33


1.  **How is Justification connected to Effectual Calling?**

	Whoever is effectually called is also justified. [WCF 11.1]
1.  **What is justification? what is it not?**

	Justification is that legal act of God by which He declares the sinner righteous on the basis of the perfect righteousness of Jesus Christ. It is not an act or a process of renewal; it does not affect the condition of the sinner, but, rather, it affects the state of the sinner. [SCD 21.1]

1.  **What role does our faith have in our justification?**

	We are justified by faith. Faith is the instrument. By faith we appropriate, that is, take unto ourselves, the righteousness of Christ, on the basis of which we are justified before God. [SCD 21.2]

1.  **What are the three elements of true faith?**

	There is an intellectual element: a recognition of the truth revealed in the Word of God. There is an emotional element: an assent, a conviction. There is a volitional element: an aspect of our will that we trust in Christ for our salvation. [SCD 20.3.b]

1.  **What invariably accompanies our faith?**

	Our faith is accompanied by all of the consequences of God's saving and loving kindness. Such faith is not dead, but works through love. [WCF 11.2] Sanctification naturally leads to a life of good works. These may be called the fruits of sanctification. Good works are not perfect works but works that spring from the principle of love to God or faith in Him; that are done in conscious conformity to the revealed will of God; and have as their final aim the glory of God. [SCD 22.3]

## Of Adoption

- WCF Chapter 12

1.  **What privileges do they enjoy?**
