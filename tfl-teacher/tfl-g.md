# Appendix G On Infant Baptism

Adapted from RC Sproul's speech at the '97 Ligonier Conference.

## Key Assumptions

a.  The Scripture explicitly nowhere commands infant baptism nor do we have any explicit prohibition against the baptism of infants. We do have explicit commands for the baptism of adults. The NT requires a prior profession of faith before baptism for adults. This should give us pause in being too critical of those who do not hold to infant baptism.

b.  Believers on both sides of the issue deeply desire to do what is right in the eyes of God and most pleasing to Him.

c.  Both sides want to be as biblically sound and be in conformity to the teachings of Scripture.

d.  The case for infant baptism must be made from inferences and implications drawn from the texts themselves along with historical and contextual evidences.

## I. THEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE

a.  It is based on our understanding of the nature of baptism and the nature of biblical covenants.

b.  It is based on our understanding of the old/new covenants and the relationship of circumcision to baptism.

c.  The old covenant is not identical with the new covenant, though there are continuities and discontinuities.

d.  Though there are elements of discontinuity, the two are not radically separated. The new covenant grows out of the old covenant and fulfills and expands the old covenant. There are profoundly important elements of continuity. Just like salvation by faith is same in OT and NT.

e.  Just as our church today is filled with baptized heathens, so Israel was populated at times with vast numbers of circumcised heathen.

f.  What do circumcision and baptism have in common?

- Both sides agree the outward sign of the New Covenant is baptism.
- In OT the sign was Circumcision while baptism is the NT sign.
- The sign in the OT signified God’s promise of blessing of salvation to all who believe. The sign did not convey salvation; it was the sign of the promise of that salvation and benefits of the promise. These benefits would only be realized by faith. Circumcision was a sign of faith just like baptism.

g.  Who is to receive this sign of faith? The NT demands that it is to be at least given to those who possess faith, but does it limit it to that? No.

h.  Calvin makes the point that the sign of faith may be given either before or after the presence of the reality that the sign signifies. (Abraham vs. Isaac) If you can prove that the sign of faith should never be given before the possession of faith, then you will destroy the OT. For the OT shows just that.

i.  Baptism does not primarily point to the reality of an internal change, but it points to the reality of our eternal God and His promises.

j.  The principal of corporate solidarity that is manifested in the context of familial solidarity. The Bible does not teach that salvation is by membership in a family nor is it inherited biologically or genetically. Yet the inclusion into the covenant community are only given on the grounds of corporate or familial solidarity, just like the solidarity that Christ assumes for those for whom he dies.

If this principal from the OT of familial solidarity is to be
abrogated, it would seem that the NT would show that explicitly. In fact, the new covenant is even more inclusive than the old one. But if you hold to adult baptism only, then it would be less inclusive than the old covenant.

## II. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

a.  The practice of infant baptism is the majority report in the church. The vast majority of denominations have chosen historically to baptize infants. Some of the reasons are fallacious, but some are sound.

b.  Earliest reference is middle of 3^rd^ century and allusions earlier. Origen, Tertullian, Iranaeus, and Appolitus support the practice was the “universal custom of the church rooted and grounded in the apostolic tradition.” (Origen quote). Two hundred years of silence?

c.  If one takes the adult baptism view and that the apostolic church did NOT practice infant baptism and that the change in practice spread throughout the whole of Christendom in just a few generations so that it becomes the universal custom in two or three generations, is it not odd that there is not a single word of protest in extant literature at that time?

We have a host of theological debates and issues that are recorded throughout this time, but not one mention of this issue. Logic would tell us that the reason that there wasn’t any debate is because everyone understood the universal practice of God of placing the sign upon his people. It did not become an issue until the church corrupted infant baptism in the same way Israel corrupted circumcision by saying the sign saves. There became an air of negligence of baptism and there was no call for personal faith and repentance. So what we’ve done to correct is to literally throw out the baby with the bathwater.

## III. BIBLICAL PERSPECTIVE

a.  In the OT, there were two types of people who were not just permitted, but were commanded to receive the sign of faith; adults with faith and their children. Exodus 4:24 – Moses almost killed for not doing this.

b.  Baptisms in the book of Acts and allusions of Paul in his letters. There are 12 citations of baptisms mentioned in the New Testament of which four are mentioned as household baptisms.

c.  The Greek word *Oikos* meaning “household” and in the field of lexicography (science of word definition), experts claim that the usage of the term in NT and OT Greek text is not as ambiguous, but that it has specific reference to infants. They may be wrong, but if they are right, the debate is over since you would have explicit references to infant baptisms. At the very least, the implicit evidence of the term favors infant baptism rather than oppose it. And at the very least, the principal of familial solidarity is clearly taught in the NT. Therefore, the same application of familial solidarity should be applied in the area of baptism.

d.  Every church that practices infant baptism also practices adult baptism. Thus, it should not be surprising that the first generation of believers in Acts were adults who then would proselytize their children. If we found in Acts, second generation believers being baptized as adults, then you have an argument against infant baptism. BUT you do not find such evidence.

e.  1 Cor. 7:12 – husband is “sanctified” by wife. This means that he is “set apart” or “consecrated” or included in the covenant community. You can be included in the covenant community and not be saved (familial solidarity). So, why would we not apply this principle to the children? If not, then our children be “unclean.” The child of a believing parent (not two parents) is considered “holy or set apart.” They are considered “clean” according to their relationship to their parent. This is Jewish cultic language and reinforces familial solidarity. Why in the world would they be denied the sign of their inclusion into the holy covenant of God? The OT children were not considered as the Gentile kids (that were unclean and unholy), so they were commanded to be circumcised.
