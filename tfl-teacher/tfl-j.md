Solus Christus (Christ alone) was a reaction to _Christ, Mary, saints_

*Worship*

Soli Deo Gloria (Glory to God alone) was a reaction to _God, saints, leaders_

Note: Authority of confessions is derived from and subordinate to
Scripture

Reformed Theology has a rich tradition of emphasizing God’s sovereignty in our salvation. Understanding this perspective on our condition and the wonderful grace of God should leave us full of both joy and humility.

However, we are not Gnostics, who believe salvation is granted only to those with special knowledge. While Reformed principles are clearly supported in the Bible, and provide greater understanding and love for the nature of God, this is not a requirement for saving faith.
