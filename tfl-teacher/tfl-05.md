## Of God’s Covenant with Man
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 7; SCD Chapters 11,13
- Appendix O - Covenants and Dispensations
- Appendix B - Comparing Arminianism and Calvinism
- Shorter Catechism 20


1.  **What is a covenant? What are the roles and responsibilities of a covenant?**
	- Synonyms: agreement, contract, pact, treaty
	- A covenant has the following characteristics:
	  - the parties: the superior offers the covenant to the subject
	  - the promise: the reward if the agreement is followed
	- the condition: the condition(s) of the agreement
	- the penalty: the penalty if the covenant is not followed
	- the sacrament: a sign to remember or confirm the agreement

1.  **Describe the covenant of works.**

	Life was promised to Adam upon condition of perfect and personal obedience [WCF 7.2]
	- parties: God and man
	- promise: Life eternal
	- condition: absolute perfect obedience
	- penalty: death
	- sacrament: ?

	Scriptures: Genesis 3 and 1 Corinthians 15:22

1.  **Describe the covenant of grace and why was it needed?**

	God’s plan to save man from the just consequences of his sin.
	- parties: God and the elect sinner in Christ
	- promise: life eternal; God’s blessing, His Spirit, and glorification
	- condition: Christ’s atoning death; it is unconditional for us in that it requires no merit on the part of the elect, but does include the requirements of faith and repentance which are provided by God
	- penalty: death, both physical and spiritual
	- sacrament: circumcision in the Old Testament and baptism in the New

1.  **Are the conditions for salvation different in the OT than in the NT?**

	The Old and New Testaments have the same condition of salvation through the covenant of grace, namely, the finished work of Christ. The Old Testament looked forward to the Messiah’s work and the New Testament looks back and looks forward to His return.

1.  **How was the covenant of grace administered in the Old Testament? In the New Testament.**

	*See WCF 7, parts 5 and 6*
1.  **List a few of the significant differences between Covenant and Dispensational approaches to salvation.**

	- God has always had one people vs. two peoples (Israel and the church)
	- Salvation is always by faith vs. different dispensations, each with its own method of obedience
	- The role of the law
	- Eschatology

## Of Christ the Mediator
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 8; SCD Chapters 14,16
- Shorter Catechism 21-30


1.  **What is the role of a mediator?**

	Definition: one who mediates, especially one who reconciles disputing parties
1.  **Outline Christ’s works as a mediator.**

	From WCF 8.4
	- was made under the law
	- he fulfilled the law, living a perfect, sinless life
	- was crucified, bearing the punishment for our sins
	- arose from the dead
	- ascended into heaven
	- sits at the right hand of God, making intercession for us
	- will return to judge men and angels at the end of the world

1.  **Describe the three offices of Christ.**
	- *Prophet*: speaks to the people on God’s behalf *see Luke 9:27, John 1:18, 15:5, 20:31, and 1 Peter 1:10-12*
	- *Priest*: speaks to God on the people’s behalf *see John 1:29, Hebrews 7:23-28, 1 Peter 3:18*
	- *King*: represents the rule of God over His people *see Daniel 7:13-14, Revelation 19:16*

## Of Free Will
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 9
- Shorter Catechism 13


1.  **How did free will look before the fall? After the fall? After Conversion? In heaven?**
	- *Before the fall*, in the state of innocency, we had the freedom and the power to do that which was pleasing to God. And we had the power also to disobey and so fall from this state of innocence.
	- *After the fall*, we have lost totally all ability to will any spiritual good to save ourselves. We are dead in sin, unable to convert ourselves. [WCF 9.2, 3]
	- *After conversion*, In a state of grace, we are freed from our bondage to sin; and through grace alone, enabled to freely will and do that which is spiritually good. Yet because of our remaining corruption, we will never do this perfectly. [WCF 9.4]
	- *In heaven*, In the state of glory, only, is our will perfectly and immutably free to do good alone

1.  **How do both Arminianism and Calvinism hinge on point one, the human condition?**

	*Is humanity able to choose to believe and to have faith?*
	- No (total depravity):
      - Then God must take the initiative and thus salvation is not conditional based our own merit or choices (unconditional election)
      - Since not all are saved and our salvation depends in no way on our actions, salvation must be limited in scope to those whom God chooses (limited atonement)
      - Since our salvation does not depend on our own merits and none of God’s people are lost (it is his work, not ours), then his actions to save us are certain (irresistible grace)
	  - We are confident that the work begun by God will be successful (perseverance of the saints)
	- Yes (some ability and goodness remains)
	  - We must be persuaded to respond to God and can if we cooperate with the Holy Spirit
	  - Christ’s death was for all; but only those who have faith are saved
	  - Since it is up to us, we can resist God’s call to repent and believe
	  - Even if we do have faith, we can fall away
