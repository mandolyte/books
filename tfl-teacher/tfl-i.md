# Appendix I - The Millennium

- **A Comparison of the Four Views of the Millennium**

## The Kingdom
- **Amillennialism** Is “now, but not yet.”
- **Post-Millennialism** Is now, and becoming more and more a reality.
- **Historic Premillennialism** Is “now, but not yet.”
- **Dispensational Premillennialism** Is somewhat now, but mostly a future idea; will be fully realized in the Millennium.

## Israel and the Church
- **Amillennialism** Church is the new Israel; no distinction between the two.
- **Post-Millennialism** Church is the new Israel; no distinction between the two.
- **Historic Premillennialism** Some distinction between the two; future for Israel, but Church is spiritual Israel.
- **Dispensational Premillennialism** Complete distinction between the two; distinct program for each.

## Second Coming
- **Amillennialism** Single event; introduces the eternal state.
- **Post-Millennialism** Single event but
occurs after the millennium.
- **Historic Premillennialism** Rapture and 2nd coming are simultaneous; Christ returns to reign during the millennium.
- **Dispensational Premillennialism** Occurs in two phases: the Church is “raptured” first, then after 7 yr. tribulation Christ returns to physically reign.

## Resurrection
- **Amillennialism** General
resurrection for all, believers and unbelievers at the second coming.
- **Post-Millennialism** General
resurrection for all, believers and unbelievers at the second coming.
- **Historic Premillennialism** Resurrection of believers at beginning of millennium; resurrection of unbelievers at the end of the millennium.
- **Dispensational Premillennialism** Various resurrections:
  - Church at Rapture
  - OT/Tribulation saints at 2nd Coming
  - Unbelievers at Millennium

## Judgements
- **Amillennialism** General judgment of all people at the same time.
- **Post-Millennialism** General judgment of all people at the same time.
- **Historic Premillennialism** Judgment at 2nd coming; judgment at Tribulation
- **Dispensational Premillennialism** Various judgments:
  - Believers at the Rapture
  - OT/Tribulation saints at end of Tribulation
  - Unbelievers at end of Millennium

## Tribulation
- **Amillennialism** Experienced now.
- **Post-Millennialism** Experienced now.
- **Historic Premillennialism** The Church goes through the Great Tribulation
- **Dispensational Premillennialism** The Church is raptured prior to the Great Tribulation

## Millennium
- **Amillennialism** Figurative, not literal; experienced now.
- **Post-Millennialism** Present age blends into millennium due to the success of the Gospel.
- **Historic Premillennialism** Millennium is both present and future, both physical and spiritual; not necessarily 1000 years.
- **Dispensational Premillennialism** A literal 1000 year physical reign of Christ; it comes after the Great Tribulation and is begun by the 2nd coming.

## Interpretation of the book of Revelation
- **Amillennialism** All of it is figurative and allegorical; seven different recapitulations: of the story of the Church’s struggle to follow Christ and His sovereign control over all things.
- **Post-Millennialism** Mostly historical; the 2nd coming is found in 20:11; martyrdom is victory not defeat.
- **Historic Premillennialism** Historical; the 2nd coming is found in 19:11-21
- **Dispensational Premillennialism** Historical and literal. ch.1-3 describe the Church in the world prior to the Great Tribulation; ch 4-19 describe the Great Tribulation; ch. 20-22 describe events after the second coming.

## Binding of Satan
- **Amillennialism** Satan was bound when Christ came at His first advent, and remains so until Christ comes again.
- **Post-Millennialism** This is a future event allowing the gospel complete freedom to take control of the earth.
- **Historic Premillennialism** This is a future event, completely removing his presence from the earth during the millennium.
- **Dispensational Premillennialism** This is a future event completely removing his presence from the earth during the millennium.
