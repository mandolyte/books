	- is for the mutual good of husband and wife
	- believers should only marry in the faith

	Marriage is the uniting of one man and one woman for a lifetime. It is designed for the mutual help and good of mankind, growth of the human race and the growth of the church. It protects against sexual immorality and is a picture of Christ's love, grace, forgiveness, joy, unity and delight in His beloved. (Genesis 2, Ephesians 5, I Corinthians 7, and Malachi 2:15)

1.  **What limitations are there on marriage?**

	- Marriage should be between those having able judgment and who consent to it

	- Adultery and wilful desertion are sufficient grounds
	- Re-marriage after a divorce on sufficient grounds is permitted and remarriage is permitted after the other party has died

1.  **What challenges does the church face today in maintaining these principles?**

	- The civil and ecclesiastical views of divorce and remarriage are not the same; thus new believers with divorce in their pasts are a common problem
	- An unbelieving spouse can divorce and even believing spouses can pursue divorce with little to hinder or dissuade them (from the church's perspective, this may be considered wilful desertion)
	- The church faces other challenges, such as gay marriage, serial marriages, cohabitation, etc.

## Of the Church
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 24

1.  **What is the definition of the church?**

	The church consists of all the elect, who have been, are now and shall be gathered into the one body of which Jesus Christ is the head. [WCF 25.1]

	The church in its essential nature includes the believers of all ages and no one else. It is the spiritual body of Christ... [SCD 23.1.b]

1.  **What is the difference between the “visible” and “invisible” church?**

	The visible church is every person in the world confessing faith in Christ and their children. It is not completely pure and subject to mixture and error. The invisible church are the elect from all ages.

	Other distinctions are the *church militant* being the church as it exists now on earth and the *church triumphant* being the church in heaven or the faithful who have died in Christ. [SCD 23.1.c]

1.  **What distinguishes a faithful church?**

	The marks of the church are:
	- Preaching of the Word

## Of the Communion of Saints
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 26


1.  **Describe the communion of the saints?**

	Communion is both a uniting and a sharing. We are united by the common blessing of salvation (see list WCF 26.1) and God's gifts to individual believers are shared with others to build up the church, both spiritually and physically.

1.  **What responsibilities do we have to each other? to God? to unbelievers?**

	To fellow believers, we seek each other's maturity in the faith and we care for one another's needs and welfare. Our concerns are for the whole person, both spiritual and physical [WCF 26.1]

	It is the responsibility of the church to equip the church members. The members are responsible for mutual ministry, submission, and promoting the peace and purity of the church as well as to participate in the ministry of the church.

	Discussion: Compare and contrast - what are our responsibilities to unbelievers?
