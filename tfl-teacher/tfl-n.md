# Appendix N - The North Cincinnati Story

We hope our story will encourage you. God created something out of nothing when He birthed NCCC. Walter Wood came to Cincinnati with his family, no contacts, and a vision - for a church that would make an impact in Cincinnati and the world. It is a true “God-thing” and we are amazed and thankful for his faithfulness, power and goodness.
