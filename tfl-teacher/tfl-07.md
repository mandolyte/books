## Of Sanctification
*Reading List:*
- WSF Chapter 13
- SCD Chapter 22
- Shorter Catechism 35,36


1.  **What is sanctification and how does it differ from justification?**

	Sanctification may be defined as that gracious and continuous operation of the Holy Spirit by which He purifies the sinner, renews his whole nature in the image of God, and enables him to perform good works. [SCD 22.1]

	It differs from justification in that it takes place in the inner life of man, is not a legal but a re-creative act, is usually a lengthy process, and never reaches perfection in this life. [SCD 22.1, WCF 13.1]

1.  **What are the two parts of sanctification?**

	It consists of two parts: the gradual removal of the pollution and corruption of human nature; and the gradual development of the new life in consecration to God. [SCD 22.1]

1.  **What errors must we guard against?**

	*Perfectionism*: the idea that we can attain perfection in this life. If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us - 1 John 1:8.

	*Apathy*: Good works and a changed life are marks of true faith. Progress in both are also marks of true faith. We are exhorted to prove our calling and election sure (2 Peter 1:10), to bear the fruits of the Spirit, to avoid a dead faith by showing our faith with our works.

1.  **What is God’s role in sanctification? What is our role?**

	From God we have his Word and his Spirit living within us, giving us a new heart and a new spirit. We must cooperate with the Spirit by making use of the means of grace to mortify (put to death) the worldliness remaining in us. The weapons in our struggle include prayer, study of God's Word, the communion of the saints, the sacraments, worship (private and corporate)

1.  **How are “good works” related to sanctification?**

	- We are being trained to practice true holiness
	- As God makes us holy, this affects every dimension of our humanity
	- We continue to develop our holiness in the fear of the Lord

	*from WCF 13.1,2, and 3*

	Sanctification naturally leads to a life of good works. These may be called the fruits of sanctification. Good works are not perfect works, but works that spring from the principle of love to God or faith in him, that are done in conscious conformity to the revealed will of God, and have as their final aim the glory of God. [SCD 22.3]

1.  **How do you explain continued sin in the believer?**

	While sanctification affects every part of man, yet the spiritual development of believers remains imperfect in this life. They must contend with sin as long as they live. Our lives are characterized by a struggle between flesh and spirit, the old man and the new man.

	True faith carries with it a sense of safety and security, though this may vary in degree. We may be swayed by doubts and uncertainties, and we are, therefore, encouraged to cultivate it. Assurance may be cultivated by prayer, by meditating on the promises of God, and by the development of a truly Christian life. [SCD 20.3.c]

## Of Saving Faith
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 14
- SCD Chapter 20
- Appendix L - The Death of Death in the Death of Christ
- Shorter Catechism 85, 86, 88


1.  **Where does faith come from? What are supporting scriptures?**

	The grace of faith is the work of the Spirit of Christ in our hearts. [WCF 14.1] It may be defined as a positive conviction, wrought in the heart by the Holy Spirit, as to the truth of the gospel and a hearty reliance on the promises of God in Christ. [SCD 20.3.a]

	Scriptures include: Acts 16:14; Ephesians 2:8,9; Romans 10:17

1.  **What are the marks of faith? Name the three elements of true faith.**

	The essential actions of faith are accepting, receiving, and resting in Jesus Christ alone for justification, sanctification, and eternal life through the virtue of God's covenant of grace [WCF 14.2]

	- A great love for God
	- Repentance from sin
	- Genuine humility
	- Devotion to God's glory
	- Continual prayer
	- Selfless love
	- Separation from the world
	- Spiritual growth
	- Obedient living

	A web search will find many other descriptions of the marks of true faith. This is just one.

	**The three elements of faith are:**

	1. *An intellectual element:* a positive recognition of the truth
	2. *An emotional element (assent):* a conviction of the truth of the gospel. It will grip our souls.
	3. *A volitional element:* an element of our will, we trust in Christ as our savior

	*from SCD 20.3.b*

1.  **What other kinds of faith are mentioned in scripture? Why are they less than “saving faith”?**

	*Historical faith:* an intellectual acceptance of the truth of Scripture without any real moral or spiritual response

	*Temporal faith:* where the gospels prompts some stirrings of conscience and emotion, but is not rooted in a regenerate heart and has no abiding character and will fall away in times of trial

	*Miraculous faith:* conviction that some miracle will be done by them or on their behalf; and which may or may not be accompanied by saving faith

	*Saving faith:* faith rooted in a regenerated heart (see above definition in question 1) [from SCD 20.3.a]

	*Compare with the Parable of the Sower, Matthew 13:4-8, 18-23*

1.  **How can we strengthen our faith?**

	It may be strengthened by the administration of the sacraments and prayer (WCF 14.1)

1.  **How does Packer explain the difference between the “new” and “old” gospel (see paragraph 4)?**

	The new gospel is too exclusively concerned to be “helpful” to man – to bring peace, comfort, happiness, satisfaction and too little concerned to glorify God. The old gospel was also helpful, but its primary concern was to give glory to God.

	The chief aim of the old gospel was to teach us to worship God. The aim of the new is to make him feel better. The subject of the old gospel was God and his ways with men; the subject of the new is man and the help God gives him.

## Of Repentance to Life
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 14
- SCD Chapter 20
- Shorter Catechism 87


1.  **What does repentance mean? Name the three parts of repentance**.

	Repentance is that change wrought in the conscious life of the sinner by which he turns away from sin.

	The three elements of repentance are:

	1. *Intellectual:* an understanding that one's past life is one of sin, involving personal guilt, defilement, and helplessness
	2. *Emotional:* a sense of sorrow for sin as committed against a holy and just God
	3. *Volitional:* consisting of a change of purpose, an inward turning from sin and a disposition to seek pardon and cleansing

	*from SCD 20.2*

1.  **What does the term “conversion” mean?**

	Conversion is that act of God, whereby He causes the regenerated, in their conscious life to turn to him in faith and repentance. [SCD 20.1] Conversion comprises two elements, the one negative and other positive, namely, repentance and faith. [SCD 20.1]

1.  **How is it different than regeneration?**

	The new life of regeneration does not of itself issue in a conscious change of life, but only through a special operation of the Holy Spirit. But while in regeneration only God works and man is passive, in conversion man is called upon to cooperate.

	... in distinction from regeneration, it is a change in the conscious rather than in the unconscious life of man. [SCD 20.1]
