# Class 9: Life in the World
## Of the Law of God
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 19
- Shorter Catechism 40-81


1.  **Describe the role of the law before the Fall of Man.**

	Before the fall, in the Covenant of Works, Adam, and his posterity, was bound to keep the law on pain of death and promise of eternal life. [WCF 19.1]

1.  **Describe the role of the law after the fall.**

	After the fall, the law is a perfect rule of righteousness, a tutor or guardian, to Christ (Galatians 3:24). In written form, the Ten Commandments, they contain our duty to God and others. [WCF 19.2]

1.  **Name the three kinds of laws and the purpose of each.**

	*Moral Law*: the moral law continues to be effective; it is our duty to God and others; by our disobedience or negligence, it is how sin is measured, understood. [WCF 19.2]

	*Ceremonial Law*: governed the the worship and religious duties of the Hebrews. It prefigured all that Christ did in his redemptive work and is abrogated by the same after Christ's death in the current era of the church. [WCF 19.3]

	*Civil Law*: are the judicial laws given to the nation of Israel. While they are not obligatory on nations today, they have great value in illustrating how the moral law and its principles may be applied to the civil laws of nations today. [WCF 19.4]

1.  **Do law and grace conflict with each other? why or why not?**

	The keeping of the law for a believer is simply pleasing God. It is what we with new hearts want to do. Because of God's grace, we no longer wish to be hostile to God, nor break his laws, nor displease him. On the contrary, we now wish to please him. The law is the prescriptive will of God; it is how we know what pleases him. See also WCF 19.7

1.  **Are we under obligation to keep the law of God? Explain.**

	Jesus strengthened rather than dissolved the law (Matthew 5:17). The law has not been revoked and has definite relevance for our lives. It is what God requires of man, though man under the covenant of grace is free from the obligation to keep it perfectly, or to state differently, we are free from the condemnation of it. The law makes clear our need of Christ. It is a standard of measure by which we may align our will to God. See WCF 19.6 for the benefits of the law to the believer.

## Of Christian Liberty
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 20
- Shorter Catechism 82-84


1.  **What is true liberty?**

	Liberty is the ability to do what we should. License is the freedom to do whatever we want. Christian liberty consists of freedom:

	- from the guilt of sin
	- from the condemning wrath of God
	- from the curse of the law

	and in being delivered from the dominion of sin, the sting of death, and the victory of the grave. [WCF 20.1]

1.  **How does Christian liberty enlarge the freedoms under the old covenant?**

	We are free from the ceremonial law and have greater access to the throne of grace, closer communion with God, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. [WCF 20.1]

1.  **How does our liberty fit with grace? with civil authority? with ecclesiastical authority?**

	We have the freedom to become what God desires us to be, fulfilling our purpose, giving us significance and meaning. This is all of grace, freeing us from the bondage to sin. Lawful authorities should be obeyed since they are appointed by God to serve him. (Rom 13:1)

1.  **What is the purpose of liberty?**

	Freedom from the bondage of our own sin; freedom from the control of others; freedom to enjoy life in good conscience, responsible only to God. [Rom 14:1-12; Gal 5:13; 1 Pet 2:16]

## Of the Worship and the Sabbath
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 21
- Shorter Catechism 88-91


1.  **What is the only reliable guide for worship?**

	While all creation shows that there is a creator who is good and worthy of worship [Psalm 19], the only reliable guide to worship is scripture, being God's self-revelation to us. [WCF 21.1]

1.  **To whom is worship due? not due?**

	Worship is to be given only to God, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. No creature, be them angels, saints, or other created being is worthy of worship. [WCF 21.2]

1.  **List all the ingredients of worship.**

	The elements of worship include [WCF 21.5]:
	- Prayer
	- Reading of Scripture
	- Sound preaching
	- Joyful singing of psalms and hymns
	- Sacraments
	- On special occasions oaths, vows, fasts, and thanksgivings

1.  **How do we benefit from keeping the Sabbath?**

	Christ says that the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath [Mark 2:27]. Its fundamental meaning is rest. Thus God wants us to rest from our ordinary occupations (worldly employment and recreations) to be refreshed and nurtured spiritually. And to, instead, do those things which serve him and others. So works of

	- piety (attending worship, preaching, nursery, etc.),
	- necessity (duties of life, emergencies, etc.), and
	- mercy (kindness to the distressed, visiting the sick, etc.)

	are all to be part of your Sabbath rest.

## Of Lawful Oaths and Vows
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 21


1.  **What is an oath? Name an example.**

	An oath is part of religious worship. To swear solemnly with God bearing witness. It is man's duty to man with God called to witness and judge. [WCF 22.1]

1.  **What is a vow? Name an example.**

	A vow is made to God. Marriage vows are to God with people as witnesses. Church membership vows are made to God in the presence of men as witnesses. [WCF 22.5,6]

1.  **What would be an improper oath or vow?**

	It is improper to swear deceptively, or too quickly (without thought of the consequences or without taking seriously the consequences), or to swear by anything else.

	- *Oaths:* We should only attest to that which we are fully persuaded to be true.
	- *Vows:* We should only commit ourselves to that which are fully able and resolved to perform.

	We may not vow to do anything forbidden by God. Nor may we vow to hinder what God's word commands.

## Of the Civil Magistrate
*Reading List:*
- WCF Chapter 23


1.  **From where does civil authority derive?**

	All lawful authority is appointed by God for his glory and for the public good. [WCF 23.1a]

1.  **What is the purpose of civil authority?**

	Civil authority has a duty to protect individuals and the entire community. They are to work for the common good and to administer justice according to the civil laws. They have the power and right to punish those who do evil. [WCF 23.1b]

1.  **What is the duty of civil authority to the church? in general, to all citizens?**

	Civil laws should not interfere with, overrule, or hinder the church in its work among those who have voluntarily joined themselves together. No one should experience bigotry because of their faith or because they have no faith. Civil authorities are obligated to keep order, so that church assemblies may meet without being molested or disturbed. [WCF 23.3]

1.  **What is the duty of the church to civil authority?**

	The people of the church have a duty to pray for their leaders. Civil leaders are owed our respect and obedience. Even if the authorities understand their faith differently or have no faith at all, Christians are to pray for, give respect to, and obey all laws which do not conflict with scripture. See Romans 13:1-7 and 1 Titus 2:1-2.

1.	**[Optional] Under what circumstances should Christians disobey civil authorities?**
