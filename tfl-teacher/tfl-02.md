# Class 2: NCCC Philosophy of Ministry
## Vision, Mission, and Values

### Our Vision
Followers of Jesus in the past summarized the purpose of human existence, saying, “Man’s chief end is to glorify God and enjoy him forever.” While this is the ultimate reason for which God made all human beings, the unique mission with which Jesus has charged the church is to “make disciples” (Matt. 28:16-20). By definition a “disciple” is a “follower” , learner , or imitator of another.

As a church, our vision is to make followers of Jesus who will in turn fulfill their chief end of enjoying and gloriying God. The result of men, women and children becoming and growing as mature and equipped followers of Christ is transformation, personally (2 Cor. 5:17) and at every level of society.

*“We exist to glorify God by making and deploying mature and equipped followers of Christ for the sake of personal, family, community, and global transformation”*

### Our Mission
The making of a mature and equipped follower of Christ is a process. Ultimately, the transformation of a person who is unfamiliar with Jesus or his church into a person who is a servant-leader like Jesus ultimately depends on the work of the Holy Spirit. However, humanly speaking that process commonly consists of the following process that makes up our mission.
1. ENGAGING the unchurched where live, work, and play
2. CONNECTING newcomers to the community of God’s people
3. ESTABLISHING members in the faith through life-on-life missional discipleship
4. DEPLOYING servant-leaders for a life of kingdom-impact

### Our Values
As we go about our mission there are several values that are most important to us:
1. Practicing indiscriminate _LOVE_ regardless of social, economic or racial status
2. Demonstrating personal, family, organizational, financial, and leadership _INTEGRITY_
3. Living by _FAITH_ in Christ and attempting faith-oriented goals in an environment of innovation
and change
4. Speaking and proclaiming the _TRUTH_ regardless of the consequences

## Our Philosophy: The Why Behind Our What
A philosophy of ministry is a way of thinking about and doing the ministry of the Church. It explains *why* we do what we do the way we do it. Our ministry philosophy is based on what we believe are the primary needs of the people that we minister to.

Those primary needs can best be expressed as:

1. *Transcendence* – The sense of being connected to a Person or Cause greater than one’s self - the need to be connected to one’s Creator, to know Him, worship Him, and serve His cause.
2. *Significance* – The need to know that one’s life counts for something, that one is making a significant contribution to the world, to have a sense of meaning and purpose.
3. *Community* – The need to have meaningful and deep relationships, and to know that you are a part of a community that knows you, cares about you, and values your gifts and personality.

How does our church intend to meet these primary needs?
1. Transcendence- To meet our member’s need for transcendence we seek to connect members and newcomers to the transcendence of God in the context of our Sunday morning worship services, and other corporate worship opportunities.
2. Significance – To meet our member’s need for significance we seek to ESTABLISH members as mature and equpped followers of Christ who engage the unchurched where they live, work and play, and are DEPLOYed to use their time, talent and treasure for a life of kingdom impact.
3. Community – To meet our member’s need for community we seek to CONNECT our
people to one another by participating in one of our Adult Communities or Small Groups.

As we walk through our Philosophy of Ministry, you will see how the way we think about and carry out our ministries begins to meet these needs in the lives of our people. The following are expressions of philosophy in each of our four major areas of mission.

### Our Philosophy: ENGAGE... How We SHARE
#### Goal:
To equip every member with a mindset and toolkit to engage the unchurched where they live, work and play.

#### Philosophy:
1. People are ordinarily won to Christ through constant exposure to God’s _word_ and God’s _people_.
2. We will use the worship service, the preaching of the word, evangelistic events, Bible studies, service projects, social events, and personal relationships to win unchurched people to Christ.
3. Our approach to evangelism will ordinarily be _proclamational, relational,
non-confrontational, and persuasive_.
4. Most of our events will have both an “_inward face_” (relevance to the believer) and an “_outward face_” (relevance to the non-believer).
5. Fervent prayer is essential: We talk to God about _men_ before we talk to men about _God_.
6. We believe the best method of evangelism is _church planting_.

### Our Philosophy: CONNECT... How We WORSHIP
#### Our Purpose in Worship:

To *glorify* God, edify the believer, and *reach* the unbeliever with the gospel.

#### Philosophy:
1. Worship is our highest value and will receive prime time , personnel, and resources.
2. We believe worship is first for the _glory_ of God. (Psalm 150)
3. We believe worship is secondly for the _edification_ of the believer. (1 Cor. 14:26)
4. We believe worship can and should be used for _evangelism_. (1 Cor. 14:24,25)
5. We believe worship should be _intelligible_ to all present, including the unbeliever. (1 Cor. 14: 19ff.) We therefore seek to contextualize our words and music in contemporary language and forms to better glorify God, (who is not glorified by worship that is unintelligible), edify the believer, and reach the unbeliever.
6. We believe worship is a participatory _dialogue_ between God and His people.
7. We believe worship has both _horizontal and vertical_ dimensions.
8. We believe worship should be both _celebratory and reflective_.
9. We believe worship should be a blend of _contemporary and traditional_ elements and expressions.
10. Worship should be in _spirit and truth_.

### Our Philosophy: CONNECT... How We CARE
#### Goal:
To provide intentional care and Christian community for every member and visitor
#### Philosophy:
1. Care is the _foundation_ of a healthy growing church. (I Peter 5:2)
2. The shepherds of the church will be held accountable for every _member_ of the church. We therefore consider the care of members our first priority. (Acts 20:28, Gal. 6:9-10)
3. We will seek to provide basic care for our _visitors_ as well.
4. Care is best provided in a _small group_, whose leader is the shepherd.
5. Everybody cares for somebody, and nobody cares for more than 10.
6. The Small Group Leaders and elders are the _shepherds_ of the church, and must receive ongoing training and care through each ministry year.
7. Christian community is a key component to effective _outreach_. (John 13:35)

### Our Philosophy: ESTABLISH... How We GROW
#### Purpose:
To equip believers for their ministries and to make mature disciples of Christ. (Eph. 4:11-12, Matt.28:19-20, Col.1:28-29)
#### Philosophy:
Making mature disciples is a life-long process that involves:
1. Consistent intake and application of God’s word.
2. Observing models of maturing Christians in daily life.
3. Accountability to the means of grace, ordinarily through a small group or mentor.
4. Active involvement in the church and the world.
5. Significant investment of time in building friendships.
6. Learning to live by faith in dependence on the power of the Holy Spirit.
7. Regular evaluation by a mentor or small group regarding spiritual progress.

#### Process:
The process by which a person become mature and equipped includes:
- 2 Step process = disillusioned learners
- 4 Step process = mature & equipped disciples

4 Steps of ESTABLISHING:
1. Direct
2. Coach
3. Support
4. Delegate

### Our Philosophy: ESTABLISH... How We GROW
#### Profile of a Maturing Disciple
1. Beliefs: Is growing in knowledge and application of the Bible and has beliefs consistent with evangelical and reformed theology.
2. Behavior: Is disciplining himself for the purpose of godliness (I Tim. 4:7)

  *In relation to God*
  - Has daily devotional exercises.
  - Worships weekly and observes the sacraments.
  - Gives regularly of his income to the church, working toward giving at least 10% per year.

  *In relation to his family*
  - Prays regularly with his spouse and children (at least once a week).
  - Regularly teaches his children from God’s word (at least once a week).
  - Intentionally seeks to love his spouse.

  *In relation to the church and the world*
  - Knows his spiritual gifts and uses them to serve others.
  - Participates in a small group for encouragement and accountability to the means of grace.
  - Has a network of three to five unchurched friends that he is praying for and seeking to expose to the gospel.

3. Character: Is growing in the likeness of Christ, measured by the increase in the fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22)

### Our Philosophy: DEPLOY... How We SERVE
#### Purpose:
To deploy our members as servant-leaders who use their time, treasure, talents, and passions for a life of kingdom impact locally and globally.
#### Philosophy:
*Mercy Ministry*
1. We believe _service_ is at the heart of being a follower of Jesus. He came not to be served but to serve and we should do likewise. (Mark 10:45)
2. We believe our first priority is to serve _members_ of our church, then regular visitors, believers outside our church family, and non-believers. (Galations 6:9-10)
3. We believe we should love not in word only, but in _deed_ and in _truth_. (1 John 3:18; James 2:15-17)
4. Every believer should know and use his _spiritual gifts_ in service in the church and in the world. (I Peter 4:10)

*World Missions*
1. We believe Jesus commanded us to take the gospel to the _world_, not just those in our community. We believe those in other lands who have not heard the gospel should have the same opportunity as those in our country.
2. We believe it to be good stewardship to invest time, money, and people in _strategic_ and _limited areas_ of the world; our plan is to help other churches do in their communities what we plan to do in ours.
3. We believe that a church should multiply itself by giving _birth_ to daughter churches as the Lord would allow.
4. We plan to allocate at least 10% of our income to _outreach_ ministries.

### Our Roles: Clarifying Expectations
#### The Role of the Church
1. A Home, providing care and spiritual nurture for those who make this their church home.
2. A Mission, remaining contemporary to its culture, equipping its members to reach the unchurched globally and locally.

What we cannot do: *Guarantee happiness, friends, or meet all expectations.*

What we intend to do: *Create an environment [a ministry “ecosystem”] where members and regulars can grow into mature and equipped followers of Christ.*

#### The Role of Staff
NCCC seeks to be _staff-equipper_ oriented:
1. We are committed to a biblical understanding of _equipping_. (Eph. 4:11,12)
2. We are committed to making the primary role of the pastor and the staff that of a _leader-equipper_.
3. The comparison between a Company and the Church:

|Company   |Church|
|----------|------|
|Owner     |God   |
|Management|Staff/Pastors|
|Employees |Members|
|Customers |Visitors (Unchurched)|

#### The Role of the Senior Pastor
1. We are committed to four elements of the senior pastor’s job description as leader:
  - First and foremost he is to spend time with the Lord discerning His leading regarding the future _direction_ of the church.
  - The leader-equipper sets _goals_ for the church according to the will of God.
  - The leader-equipper secures goal _ownership_ from the session and the people.
  - The leader-equipper sees that each member of the church is properly _equipped_ to do his or her part in accomplishing those goals.
2. We are committed to limiting the pastoral responsibilities of the pastor.
3. We are committed to these elements of the pastor’s job description as pastor:
  - To shepherd the _leaders_.
  - To shepherd in _crisis_ situations.
  - To shepherd those in _non-crisis_ situations who make their needs known and no one is equipped to minister to them.

#### The Role of Elders
1. In general, elders are committed to the spiritual welfare of the church.
2. Their primary responsibilities are: shepherding, teaching, and prayer.
3. Other responsibilities include:
  - Maintaining vision, mission, values, and goals.
  - Receiving new members
  - Exercising church discipline
  - Assisting in serving the sacraments

#### The Role of Deacons
1. In general, deacons are committed to the material well being of the church.
2. Their responsibilities include:
  - Management of church property and equipment
  - Material and physical needs of others
  - Sunday set-up, management, and close-up (ushers, offerings, communion, walk-around, Sunday School set-up, heat, lights, emergencies, security)
  - Financial monitoring

#### The Role of Women
1. May be teachers
2. May not be officers
3. May lead
4. Should be employed as Jesus employed them

#### The Role of Members
North Cincinnati seeks to be _member-minister_ oriented:
1. We are committed to making every member a _minister_.
2. We believe the member’s responsibility is fourfold:
  - Each member should discover and use his/her _spiritual gift(s)_.
  - Each member should view himself/herself as a _minister_ in the church.
  - Each member should invest time in being _equipped_ to use his/her spiritual gifts in a ministry.
  - Each member should invest time in _using_ his/her spiritual gifts in ministry

#### The Role of Goals
NCCC seeks to be goal-oriented.
1. Faith-oriented goals give us the opportunity to see God work and to have our faith enlarged.
2. We believe in setting goals that are both quantitative and qualitative.
3. We believe our responsibilities in achieving these goals are to pray without ceasing and to work diligently.

#### The Role of Standards
1. We are committed to _biblical_ membership standards.
2. We are committed to _high_ standards for our officers.
3. We are committed to building a ministry dominated by _progressives
and conservatives_.

#### Four Types Of Laymen
1. Radicals
  - Source of many good ideas
  - Prone to challenging the leadership  
  - Quick starters, sometimes not good finishers  
  - Often driven from the system due to lack of change  
2. Progressives
  - Anticipate growth opportunities  
  - Live on growth edge  
  - Readily perceive benefits in good planning  
  - Spearhead new directions  
  - Communicate well to the conservatives  
  - Risk takers  
3. Conservatives
  - See the value in the status quo
  - Often hesitant to jeopardize personal comfort
  - Need real answers to questions prior to moving
  - Will keep the radical and progressives (in leadership) balanced
  - Carry most of the financial burden
  - Not risk takers
4. Traditionalists –
  - Resistant to change
  - Have difficulty buying into new and perhaps better ways

*(Source: John Wimber, Church Growth Syllabus), Founder of the Vineyard Movement*

#### The Generations of New Ministries:
The First Generation: A high percent of radicals and progressives.  
The Second Generation: A high percent of progressives and conservatives  
The Third Generation: Typically dominated by traditionalists, committed to
keeping things the same.
